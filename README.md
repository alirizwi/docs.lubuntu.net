# Lubuntu Documentation

## About lubuntu
[Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net) is a fast and lightweight operating system. The core of the system is based on Linux and Ubuntu. Lubuntu uses the minimal desktop LXDE, and a selection of light applications. It focuses on speed and energy-efficiency. Because of this, Lubuntu has very low hardware requirements.

## System Requirements
Our tests show that until version 16.04 lubuntu can be installed on a Pentium II or Celeron system with 256 MB RAM to get a usable system. With 512 MB of RAM, you do not need to worry much. The recommended "Desktop" installer after version 17.04 is 1 GB of RAM. For PCs with less resources, you can also try an alternative installer, that should still work with lower requirements from the download pages.

## Applications in lubuntu

lubuntu is a full-featured desktop, that includes a selection of lightweight tools and applications. Here are links with details and the list of [Installed Tools](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Setup#Installed_Tools) and [Applications in lubuntu.](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Setup#Applications)
